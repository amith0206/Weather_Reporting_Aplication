# Weather_Reporting_Aplication
Weather Reporting Application
This is a simple weather reporting application that retrieves the current weather information for a specified location using the WeatherAPI. The application allows users to input their desired location either by typing it or speaking it using speech recognition. The application then fetches the weather data from the WeatherAPI and displays the location, temperature, condition, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, it converts the weather report into speech using a text-to-speech engine.

# Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
requests library (pip install requests) \
speech_recognition library (pip install SpeechRecognition) \
pyttsx3 library (pip install pyttsx3)

# Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Obtain an API key from the WeatherAPI service. Sign up for an account on their website and generate an API key specifically for your application.

Open the weather_reporting.py file in a text editor.

Replace the placeholder value ("992f3386be2c4b1687085857230106") assigned to the api_key variable with your actual WeatherAPI key.

Save the file.

Run the python script.

The application will prompt you to speak your city name. Speak clearly into your microphone and wait for the recognition.

The application will retrieve the weather data for the specified location and display it in the console.

The weather report will also be converted into speech and played through your speakers.

Enjoy the weather report!

# Note:
If you encounter any issues with speech recognition, make sure you have a working microphone connected to your computer and the necessary audio drivers installed.

# Important Note
Make sure to keep your API key confidential and avoid sharing it publicly. Sharing your API key can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of your account.

# Limitations
The code provided fetches the current weather data only. If you wish to fetch forecasts or historical weather data, you would need to modify the code accordingly.
The accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on factors such as microphone quality and background noise. Make sure to speak clearly and in a quiet environment for better recognition.
